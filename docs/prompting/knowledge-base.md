## Document 2: Account Creation
To use Shoplite, customers need to create an account. Signing up requires a valid email address, a password, and acceptance of Shoplite’s terms of service. Optionally, users can register using Google or Facebook login. After creating an account, users can manage profile details, shipping addresses, and payment methods from the Account Settings page. A verified email is required for order confirmations and password resets. Accounts that remain inactive for long periods may be flagged for review, but they are not automatically deleted. Shoplite ensures user data is stored securely, following encryption standards and privacy rules.

## Document 3: Browsing and Search
Customers can browse products by category, filter by price, rating, or brand, and use Shoplite’s search bar. The search engine supports typeahead suggestions, where results appear as the user types. Recommendations are shown based on browsing history and popular products. Each product page displays images, descriptions, price, available stock, shipping options, and user reviews. Shoplite also provides sorting options like “lowest price,” “highest rating,” or “new arrivals.” Products out of stock are clearly labeled, and customers can request notifications when stock is replenished.

## Document 4: Ordering Process
Placing an order on Shoplite is straightforward. Customers add items to the cart, review them at checkout, and choose a delivery address and payment method. Orders can be edited before final confirmation. Once placed, an order confirmation email is sent with an order ID and details. Customers can track order status from “Processing” → “Shipped” → “Out for Delivery” → “Delivered.” Cancellations are possible while the order is still in the Processing stage. After that, cancellation requires contacting customer support. Shoplite does not guarantee cancellations once an order is in the Shipped stage.

## Document 5: Payment Methods
Shoplite accepts Visa, Mastercard, American Express, PayPal, and cash on delivery (COD) for eligible regions. Payments are processed securely using encrypted gateways. COD has a handling fee and is only available for orders under $200. Prepaid methods (credit/debit cards, PayPal) are encouraged as they speed up delivery. Shoplite never stores card details directly; instead, tokenized information is saved with trusted payment providers. Failed payments may result in order cancellation unless corrected within 24 hours. Customers are advised not to share payment details with anyone claiming to represent Shoplite outside the official app or website.

## Document 6: Shipping Policy
Shoplite ships to most countries, with shipping fees depending on region, weight, and delivery speed. Standard delivery typically takes 5–7 business days, while express delivery arrives within 2–3 business days. Orders above $100 qualify for free standard shipping. Shipping status is updated in real-time through the user’s account. Shoplite partners with multiple courier services, including DHL, FedEx, and national carriers. Delivery times may be affected by holidays or customs checks. Customers should ensure their shipping address is correct to avoid delays, as incorrect addresses may cause orders to be returned.

## Document 7: Returns and Refunds
Shoplite allows returns within 30 days of delivery, provided items are unused, in original packaging, and accompanied by proof of purchase. Certain products like perishable goods, intimate wear, or digital downloads are not eligible for return. Refunds are processed within 7–10 business days after items are inspected. If the original payment was by credit card or PayPal, refunds are issued back to the same method. For COD orders, refunds are provided as store credit. Return shipping is free if the product was damaged, defective, or incorrect. Otherwise, return shipping costs may apply.

## Document 8: Warranty Policy
Many Shoplite products come with a manufacturer’s warranty, usually 6–12 months depending on the item. Warranty covers defects in material or workmanship, but not damage from misuse, accidents, or normal wear and tear. To make a warranty claim, customers need to contact Shoplite support with the order ID and product details. The item may be repaired, replaced, or refunded depending on the issue. Shoplite acts as a facilitator between customers and manufacturers but cannot override manufacturer policies. Customers should retain the original invoice for warranty purposes.

## Document 9: Shoplite Drops
Shoplite hosts “Drops,” where exclusive or limited-time products go live. Drops usually include electronics, sneakers, or special collaborations. Each drop is announced in advance via email and notifications. Quantities are often limited, and orders are first-come-first-serve. Customers should ensure payment and shipping details are saved beforehand to increase chances of success. Orders in drops cannot be canceled once confirmed, due to the time-sensitive nature. Shoplite uses queueing systems to handle high demand during drops, and users may face waiting rooms before checkout.

## Document 10: Customer Support
Shoplite’s customer support is available 24/7 via live chat, email, and a help center. Common issues include tracking orders, return requests, and payment problems. The AI-powered support assistant can handle many standard questions, such as shipping times or refund status. Complex issues can be escalated to a human agent. Response time for live chat is usually under 2 minutes, while email responses may take up to 24 hours. Customers are encouraged to use the Help Center first, as many answers are documented there.

## Document 11: Privacy and Security
Shoplite takes privacy seriously. Personal data such as name, email, and address is collected for order fulfillment and customer service. Payment details are never stored directly.

Cookies are used to improve browsing, and customers can adjust cookie settings. Shoplite uses encryption for all data transfers and performs regular audits of its systems to prevent breaches.

## Document 12: Loyalty Program
Shoplite runs a loyalty program called “Shoplite Rewards.” Customers earn 1 point per $1 spent. Points can be redeemed for discounts (100 points = $1 discount). Members also receive early access to drops and special promotions. Rewards points expire after 12 months of inactivity. Points cannot be transferred between accounts and have no cash value. Customers can track their points in the Account Settings page. Shoplite reserves the right to change or discontinue the program at any time.

## Document 13: Promotions and Discounts
Shoplite frequently offers seasonal promotions, coupon codes, and flash sales. Coupons are entered during checkout and apply only once per order. Discounts may not stack with other offers. Flash sales are limited to stock availability and usually last 24–48 hours. Products purchased on promotion are still eligible for returns, unless marked as “final sale.” Shoplite sometimes offers student discounts and free shipping promotions, which require verification through partner services. Customers should always check validity dates on coupons.

## Document 14: Review System
Customers can leave reviews and ratings on products they purchased. Reviews require a verified account and proof of purchase. Ratings are on a 1–5 star scale, and customers can add written feedback and photos. Shoplite monitors reviews for inappropriate content and may remove fake or abusive reviews. Reviews are valuable for other shoppers and help Shoplite improve its catalog. Customers cannot edit reviews after posting, but they may request removal through support.

---

## Document 15: Seller Partnerships
In addition to Shoplite’s own products, third-party sellers can list items on the platform. Sellers must pass verification checks and agree to Shoplite’s policies. Shoplite holds seller payments in escrow until orders are confirmed delivered. If disputes arise, Shoplite mediates between customer and seller. Seller ratings are shown publicly, and low-performing sellers may be removed. Third-party products are covered by Shoplite’s return and refund policies unless otherwise specified.

## Document 16: Mobile App
Shoplite’s mobile app is available on iOS and Android. The app offers push notifications for drops, promotions, and delivery updates. Customers can enable biometric login for security. The app includes features like scanning barcodes to find products, voice search, and in-app chat support. Offline browsing allows customers to save wishlists and carts without internet, syncing when online. App updates are released monthly with bug fixes and new features. Customers are encouraged to keep the app updated for the best experience.

---

## Document 17: Order Tracking
After placing an order, customers can track status in their account. Tracking shows steps from “Processing” to “Delivered.” Once shipped, a tracking number is provided with courier details. Customers receive notifications at each stage. If tracking shows “Delivered” but the item is missing, customers should report within 48 hours. Shoplite will investigate with the courier. Delays are sometimes caused by customs or weather, but Shoplite updates status promptly when information is available.

---

## Document 18: Cancellation Policy
Orders can be canceled without penalty during the Processing stage. Once shipped, cancellation is not guaranteed. Customers must contact support for exceptions. If the courier returns a package due to incorrect address or failed delivery attempts, Shoplite may refund the order minus shipping fees. Drops and limited-edition items cannot be canceled once confirmed. Customers should double-check details before submitting an order to avoid issues.

## Document 19: Environmental Responsibility
Shoplite is committed to reducing its environmental impact. Packaging is recyclable, and customers are encouraged to recycle. The company partners with eco-friendly couriers where possible. Customers can opt for “green shipping,” which uses slower but lower-carbon delivery methods.

By making sustainable choices, Shoplite aims to balance convenience with responsibility.
